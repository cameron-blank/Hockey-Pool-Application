# Hockey Pool Application
This is a hockey pool application that I have been working on. The basic idea is that, given a list of pool teams (the name of each team along with a list of players on that team) and some scoring criteria, the application should be able to output the hockey pool standings by accessing the NHL's publicly available API.

This is still very much in-progress. The end-goal would be to give it some sort of interface, possibly turning it into an Android app.
